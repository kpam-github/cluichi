This is a template for a Javascript multiplayer online game.
App.js has several constants that allow you to enable / disable certain features.

The template is currently hosted at the following address:
https://game-template.herokuapp.com/

While searching for free hosts I came across Heroku and Openshift.
This is configured to work on local machines and when hosted on Heroku.
Openshift's latest version has deprecated the way Node.js apps are hosted and
any configuration documentation I could find online was for the previous version.
